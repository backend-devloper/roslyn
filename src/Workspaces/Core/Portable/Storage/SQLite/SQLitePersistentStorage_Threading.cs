        /// Thread A starts a transaction that starts as a reader, and later attempts to perform a
        /// write. Thread B is a writer (either started that way, or started as a reader and

        /// can start writing. A holds a SHARED lock (it's a reader) and tries to acquire RESERVED
        /// lock (so it can start writing).  The only way to make progress in this situation is for
        /// one of the transactions to roll back. No amount of waiting will help, so when SQLite
        /// detects this situation, it doesn't honor the busy timeout.
        ///

        /// can concurrently read, and operations that exclusively write.
