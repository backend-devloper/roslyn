    ''' <summary>
    ''' This class is a cache of thumbnail images that are kept in an ImageList and intended to be used with
    '''   a listview working in virtual mode.  The maximum size and expected
    '''   working set of the imagelist can be specified, and thumbnails will be recycled as needed.
    '''   This class works by associated each thumbnail with an object key (a Resource object).  When you 
    '''   have a thumbnail that you want cached, you add it with an associated key.
    '''   Whenever you need an index into the imagelist 
    '''   you *must* call GetImageListIndex() to look for it first, because it's possible that the 
    '''   thumbnail has been recycled in order to make room for another thumbnail.
    '''
    ''' Note that we can't simply use bitmaps for the thumbnail images in the ListView, because it only
    '''   supports retrieving images from an ImageList (well, in Whidbey there's new support for bitmaps,
    '''   but it's not very efficient and still uses an ImageList).  If we created an ImageList large enough
    '''   to hold a thumbnail for every single resource, that would not scale very well with large resx files
    '''   (esp. since we're using a virtualized listview and doing other work to delay load images from disk),
    '''   therefore we need to take the caching approach.
