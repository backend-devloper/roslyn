    ''' <summary>
    ''' This class represents the root component of the resource editor.  It could be thought of as
    '''    resepenting the .resx file itself, except that we may handle more than one .resx file in 
    '''    the resource editor at once.  
    '''    This class itself does not do much except to keep a reference to ResXResourceFile(s) being
    '''    edited.  If this were a "real" component, this class would represent the component whose
    '''    properties are being edited (think of a form, for instance).  Thus this class only
    '''    manages the state of the edited object.  Persistence is handled in the code loader, and the
    '''    UI is handled by the ResourceEditorRootDesigner.
