    // A node table is the fundamental structure we use to track changes through the incremental 
    // generator api. It can be thought of as a series of slots that take their input from an
    // upstream table and produce 0-or-more outputs. When viewed from a downstream table the outputs
    // are presented as a single unified list, with each output forming the new input to the downstream
    // table.
    // 
    // Each slot has an associated state which is used to inform the operation that should be performed
    // to create or update the outputs. States generally flow through from upstream to downstream tables.
    // For instance an Added state implies that the upstream table produced a value that was not seen 
    // in the previous iteration, and the table should run whatever transform it tracks on the input 
    // to produce the outputs. These new outputs will also have a state of Added. A cached input specifies
    // that the input has not changed, and thus the outputs will be the same as the previous run. Added,
    // and Modified inputs will always run a transform to produce new outputs. Cached and Removed
    // entries will always use the previous entries and perform no work.
    // 
    // It is important to track Removed entries while updating the downstream tables, as an upstream 
    // remove can result in multiple downstream entries being removed. However, once all tables are up 
    // to date, the removed entries are no longer needed, and the remaining entries can be considered to
    // be cached. This process is called 'compaction' and results in the actual tables which are stored
    // between runs, as opposed to the 'live' tables that exist during an update.
    // 
    // Modified entries are similar to added inputs, but with a subtle difference. When an input is Added
    // all outputs are unconditionally added too. However when an input is modified, the outputs may still
    // be the same (for instance something changed elsewhere in a file that had no bearing on the produced
    // output). In this case, the state table checks the results against the previously produced values,
    // and any that are found to be the same instead get a cached state, meaning no new downstream work 
    // will be produced for them. Thus a modified input is the only slot that can have differing output 
    // states.
