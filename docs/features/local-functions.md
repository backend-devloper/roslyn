- [ ] Parser ambiguity research
	- Some thought done, not complete
	- Currently thought to be unambiguous past the parameter list (starting at `{` or `=>`), but that requires lots of lookahead.
- [x] N-level nested local functions
- [ ] Capture
	- [x] Initial implementation
	- [ ] Tests
	- [x] IDE integration
	- Works alongside lambdas and behaves very similarly
	- No optimized closures (by-ref parameters instead of closure class)
- [x] Standard parameter features
	- params
	- ref/out
	- named/optional
- [x] Visibility
	- May revisit design (currently shadows, may do overloads)
- [ ] Generics
	- [x] Nongeneric local functions in generic methods (same as lambdas).
	- [x] Generic local functions in nongeneric methods.
	- [x] Generic local functions in generic methods.
	- [x] Arbitrary nesting of generic local functions.

	- [ ] Generic local functions with constraints.
- [ ] Inferred return type
- [x] Iterators
- [x] Async
- [ ] API
- [ ] Editor
	- [x] Basic features (variable highlight, rename, etc.)
	- [ ] Advanced features (refactorings, analyzers)
