# IDE Team Design Process

## Discussions / Issues

The goal is that folks can create and discuss feature suggestions without needing to have verything fully figured out. Feel free to file a new feature suggestion and members of the oslyn-IDE team will add the "[Feature Request](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues?=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22Feature+Request%22)" label. However, hese feature suggestions won't be discussed until we have a proposal written for them.

## Proposals

### Adding a proposal

For a feature proposal to be reviewed a design proposal needs be appended to the github ssue. It should have the following information:

- **Summary**: Brief summary of what this proposal is about
- **Background and Motivation**: What the problem is we are solving and in what context did ou encounter it?
- **Proposed Feature**: How the proposed solution solves the problem
- **Alternative Designs**: Were there other options you considered? How does this compare to eatures in other editors?

### Getting the issue championed by the IDE team

A member of [Roslyn-IDE](https://github.com/orgs/dotnet/teams/roslyn-ide) will need to decide to "champion" that feature proposal and add it to the "On Deck" tab in the [IDE Design Review](ttps://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/projects/40) project. Behind the scenes the IDE Team tries to meet once a week to discuss these item.
